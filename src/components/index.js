// Exporting all the components as default thus we do not have to write import for all components in a seperate line.
// (look at the import statement in app.js to understand this)

export { default as Cards } from './Cards'
export { default as Home } from './Home'
export { default as NavBar } from './NavBar'
export { default as ScoreBoard } from './ScoreBoard'
